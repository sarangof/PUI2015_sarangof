# PUI2015_sarango

This is a ReadMe file to show my process of creating an environment variable and an alias via bashrc and a virtual Ubuntu Machine on Windows (I was a Ubuntu user until some months ago when I decided to go back to Windows for office work purposes. Never a clever decision. Never)

First, a screenshot of the PUI2015 directory I created in Ubuntu. I created the environment variable PUI2015 and the alias pui2015, so using cd with PUI2015 takes me to the directory, but the alias does the cd operation for me so I only need to type it and it is all set.

The following screenshots show how I declared the env variable and the alias in my bashrc (both the variable and the alias are at the bottom of the gedit window).
