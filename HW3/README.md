Readme file

This folder includes part 1, 2 and 3 of homework 3 of Principles of Urban Informatics. Homework 3 is in a separate folder. It made more sense for me to have the third part of the homework here than in the folder named "Citibike" in this same repository.

Download the files as ipython notebooks and execute them. Some images will not load because they are hosted in a local machine. Note that the packages matplotlib, pylab and numpy are used.
