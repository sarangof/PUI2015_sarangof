NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the choice of a single color colormap is great: it shows gradients intuitively without suggesting anything else. however the color map has a large gradient between the first and se second color (gray to pink) which is misleading as it separates the locations with this color as different, while the range is 0-2: an interval as any other in the carbon emission scale.

the upper range is not bound. it should be shown somwehre for reference what the true range is

the granularity is not explained. ane xplaination for it does not necessarily belong in the plot but if this were included in a document it should certainly be explained why some regions are very finely sampled and others are note 

alaska and hawaii are nicely included and separated appropriately but he gray lines (though the polygon around hawaii has a lot of sides that are not necessary separating empty space between HW and AK giving the odd impression that HW is surrounded

"Figure" is not needed in the figure title/caption





NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================

============

while esthetically appealing, plotting such large datasets with points is confusing and does not allow easy comparison and assessment of the value of the data. 
(e.g. what does the largest duration for female riders correspond to? somewhere around 1978 but it is hard to be more precise)

the datapoints hide a pattern in the data: the age increases more significantly for women, peaking around 1980, but it is hard to tell.

the purple foreground datapoints hide the background yellow datapoints -> confusion and ambiguity. 

tick labels are too small

the y axis in seconds offers unnecessary grabularity: minutes would be better and more readable. even hours.




fmzingler
============


the time series are of very different order of magnitude. thus all of them are unvisible and cluster at the bottom . log y should be used.

the axis labels are way too small

there are too many time series on the plot. even with log space the result would likely be confusing. 

the color of the time seres is repeated leading to complete confusion

============


too m any categories: the difference in size cannot be told apart

x, y labels and ticks and title  too small

circles size and transparency used to convey the same information: this just makes things confusing.
