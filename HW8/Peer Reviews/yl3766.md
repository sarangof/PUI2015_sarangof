+ Clarity: It is not specially clear to read. The units are clear. I think a title or a source of data would be missing (I thought that the data was to be from PUI homeworks or labs. Nevertheless this is very interesting).

+ Esthetic: The points could be a little bigger and the colors could have a softer palette. I know that the colors come from clustering for three groups but it would be interesting at least to know that for sure. The zeroes in the values stack up, maybe integers and a power of ten on the labels would be enough and declutter the plot.

+ Honesty: Seems clear enough to me but it would be important to notice that the clustering comes from non supervised training, and that the colors do not correspond to any other factor that a person might imagine just by seeing the picture alone.
