+ I thought that the plot was supposed to be made with data that was used for PUI classes or homeworks, it is a very interesting topic though.
+ The plot is relatively easy to read, it is missing the units of distance and price.
+ It would be very useful to visualize the distribution of prices and distance for both categories, as an initial approach. Altought the point that airbnb is cheaper and apparently just as close to places of interest is being made, maybe barplots or density plots on the side would be useful to make sense of the big amount of dots, since all of them are not needed and it is impossible to pick up the different distributions just by eye. Instead, all the points can be distracting.
+ Esthetically, the fonts could be bigger.
+ The title could be clearer, the labels do tell the story but it is not straightforward.
+ I think the plot is clear and readable enough.
