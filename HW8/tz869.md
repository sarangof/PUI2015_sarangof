+ The circles indicating income per race should be on top of all other features in the plot, otherwise visibility is lost.
+ The regression names lose sense in the plot on their own. They would need different names that were more descriptive of the equation being modeled.
+ The grey dots are not explained by the label

+ CLARITY: It is relatively easy to read.
+ ESTHETIC: I would chop the upper part of the plot (from $40.000 to $50.000) only because there are no dots there. One of the regression lines is barely visible (the regression through 0).
+ HONESTY: The plot is honest enough but it should be made clear that the dashed black line would be the "equal payment" condition. Of course, we need to be careful with interpretation, only because, although wage differentiation is a true problem, many women do decide to get less rewarding jobs in exchange for the possibility to stay home, or because there might be higher educational attainment for women than for men. This is not something that the plot could tell, just my own thought.
